## Setting up
To set up a local copy of the git repository cd to where you want it and type:
git clone https://github.com/1011776/HS1511-CCGS.git

This code will add/stage the changes you have made, you need to do this before you commit:
git add –all 

This will commit a change to your local copy but not the remote copy on GitHub:
git commit -m “YOUR MESSAGE HERE”

This will push your changes to the remote copy on git:
git push

If you need to revert back to the remote copy, commit your changes then type this:
git pull

This shows you all the changes you have made:
git status
